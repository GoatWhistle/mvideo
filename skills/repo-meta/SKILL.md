# Repository description and topics

The "About" box is the first text a judge reads, in the org list, in search and on the repo page.
It is one rule and one definition, not a slogan. Topics make the repo findable and show the stack
at a glance.

## 1. Inputs

The README promise and main rule, `docs/for-jury.md`, `brief/PLATFORM.md` (required tags, the
event and sponsor names), the stand URL, and the real stack:

```bash
node skills/repo-meta/meta.mjs scan
```

prints every technology found in `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, requirements, `Cargo.toml`,
`go.mod`, `Gemfile`, Dockerfiles and compose files, marked `stack` (worth a topic) or `lib`
(usually not).

## 2. Description

English, 140–300 characters (GitHub allows 350, lists cut earlier), no trailing period at the
very end. Two parts:

1. **The rule.** What the product guarantees or refuses, as a falsifiable sentence about behaviour.
   Name who decides what: the model, the code, the human. Often a contrast: what everyone else
   trusts and what this product trusts instead.
2. **What it is.** A noun phrase: category, for whom or which domain, and the one constraint that
   matters (offline, local models, no paid API, a regulation it follows).

Patterns that work:

| Pattern | Shape |
| --- | --- |
| Guarantee + definition | "Every {{output}} comes with {{proof}}. {{What it refuses instead of guessing}}. {{Category}} for {{domain}} on {{constraint}}" |
| Division of labour | "The LLM only {{proposes}}; the code {{checks/decides}}. {{Second guarantee}}. {{Category}} for {{domain}}" |
| Reframe | "{{Common belief}} don't {{X}}, they {{Y}}. {{Product}} {{catches Y}}, {{fixes it}} and {{proves it}}" |
| Refusal | "{{Category}} that {{does the job}} and says what it could not {{do}}: {{concrete list}}" |

Rules:

- Concrete nouns and verbs from the domain; a number only if it is in `docs/evidence.md`.
- No product name at the start (GitHub shows it), no "this project", "a tool that", "a platform
  that", "solution", "AI-powered", "innovative", "seamless", "robust", "leverage", "empower",
  "next-generation", "designed to", "aims to", "helps you", "built with".
- No em or en dashes, no spaced hyphens, no arrows, no middle dots, no emoji: use a period, a
  colon, a semicolon or a comma. Chains are written in words ("from the crude unit to diesel
  blending"), never with arrows.
- Not a feature list, not the hackathon name (that is a topic), not the team.
- Pass it through the `humanizer` skill, then read it aloud: if it sounds like a landing page,
  rewrite the rule.

Bad and better:

| Bad | Better |
| --- | --- |
| "AI-powered copilot web application that helps small businesses solve legal and financial tasks" | "Every answer cites the law or the bank rule it relies on, or says it has none. Assistant for small business owners on legal and financial questions" |
| "Smart platform for supplier search using cutting-edge ML" | "Each recommended supplier comes with proof: a past bid, a catalogue offer or a registry record. Supplier search for public procurement on local models" |
| "Advisor — given, derived or measured → recommendation" | "Every number carries its origin, and a calculation that needs an unknown returns unknown instead of a constant. Process advisor for a refinery unit chain" |

## 3. Topics

10–20 topics (GitHub allows 20), lowercase, digits and hyphens, at most 50 characters each. Build
them in this order and stop at 20:

| Group | Count | What |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Event | 1–3 | `hackathon`, plus the sponsor or platform tag when the rules ask for it |
| Domain | 2–4 | Where it lives: `public-procurement`, `healthcare`, `oil-and-gas`, `robotics` |
| Mechanism | 3–6 | What makes it different: `explainable-ai`, `deterministic`, `hybrid-search`, `human-in-the-loop`, `knowledge-graph`, `provenance` |
| Problem | 1–3 | What someone would search for: `supplier-search`, `pii-detection`, `medication-safety` |
| Stack | 4–7 | Only `stack` entries from `scan`: language, framework, datastore, ML engine, `docker` |

- Prefer the established spelling GitHub already uses (`llm`, `rag`, `nextjs`, `postgresql`,
  `react`, `typescript`, `llm-agents`) over invented ones.
- Never `css`, `html`, `js`, `ai`, `app`, `project`, `web`, `tool`: noise that matches everything.
- No technology that is not in the code; `scan` and `check` catch both directions.
- Keep the same mechanism tags across the team's projects when they are true: a consistent org
  looks deliberate.

## 4. Check and apply

Write the proposal to `work/repo.json`:

```json
{
  "repo": "{{owner}}/{{repo}}",
  "name": "{{repo}}",
  "description": "{{rule}}. {{definition}}",
  "homepage": "https://{{DOMAIN}}",
  "topics": ["hackathon", "{{domain}}", "{{mechanism}}", "{{stack}}"]
}
```

```bash
node skills/repo-meta/meta.mjs check work/repo.json
```

It fails on length over 350, dashes, arrows, emoji, banned phrases, noise topics, invalid or
duplicate topics and more than 20 of them; it warns on a long or short description, a trailing
period, stack topics missing from the code and headline stack missing from topics. Then it prints
the `gh repo edit` commands. Changing the public repo is an outward action: show the description,
the topics and the commands to the user and run them only when asked.

Done when `check` has 0 errors, the description was read aloud once, and the user has the commands
or confirmed they were applied.
